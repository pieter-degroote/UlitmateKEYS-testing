# UltimateKEYS - Testing
Testing repository for UltimateKEYS

**Official release :**&emsp;[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/pieter-degroote/UltimateKEYS.svg)](https://github.com/pieter-degroote/UltimateKEYS/releases)

## Experimental support for AutoHotkey v2.0 alpha :

See the folder **`autohotkey-v2.0-alpha`** for experimental support.

## Overlay scripts for United States-International keyboard layout :

See the folder **`autohotkey-kbdusx`** for the overlay scripts for "United States-International".

These scripts should have the exact same functionality as the main editions, but are intended as overlays for "United States-International" (all regular AHK scripts are overlays for standard US QWERTY instead).

## AZERTY version :

See the folder **`azerty-test`** for an experimental edition featuring an AZERTY version of the keyboard layout.

## Belgian AZERTY (variants) :

Belgian AZERTY layouts in AHK (overlay scripts for US QWERTY). These scripts can also be used to learn about the different key remappings and assignments in AutoHotkey.

Otherwise, it might be impossible to type any Unicode character higher than "Basic Latin" at the login screen/prompt (due to a different keyboard configuration) !&emsp;=&gt;&emsp;ACCOUNT LOCKOUT
