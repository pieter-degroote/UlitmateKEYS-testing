# UltimateKEYS - Testing
Testing repository for UltimateKEYS

**Official release :**&emsp;[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/pieter-degroote/UltimateKEYS.svg)](https://github.com/pieter-degroote/UltimateKEYS/releases)

## Experimental support for AutoHotkey v2.0 alpha :

See the folder **`autohotkey-v2.0-alpha`** for experimental support.

## Overlay scripts for United States-International keyboard layout :

See the folder **`autohotkey-kbdusx`** for the overlay scripts for "United States-International".

These scripts should have the exact same functionality as the main editions, but are intended as overlays for "United States-International" (all regular AHK scripts are overlays for standard US QWERTY instead).

## AZERTY version :

See the folder **`azerty-test`** for an experimental edition featuring an AZERTY version of the keyboard layout.

## Concept with 'chained dead keys' :

See the folder **`concept-chained-dead-keys`** for experiments featuring `If Else` and `Switch Case` structures.
