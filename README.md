# UltimateKEYS - Testing
A testing repository for UltimateKEYS

## Overlay scripts for United States-International keyboard layout :

See the folder **`autohotkey-v1.1-kbdusx`** for the overlay scripts for "United States-International".

These scripts should have the exact same functionality as the main editions, but are intended as overlays for 'United States-International'.

## Experimental support for AutoHotkey v2.0 alpha :

See the folder **`autohotkey-v2.0-alpha`** for experimental support.

## CE (Compact Edition) for French and English :

See the folder **`compact-edition`** for a simplified test version which allows faster access to letters with a circumflex accent (â, ê, î, ô, û), but at the cost of removing some dead keys (which can be useful for French and accented English).

## Concept with 'chained dead keys' :

See the folder **`concept-chained-dead-keys`** for experiments featuring `If, Else` and `Switch Case` structures.

## For official releases, please see :
