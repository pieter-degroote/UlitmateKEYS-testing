## Support for AutoHotkey v2.0 (beta 3)

See the folder **`autohotkey-v2.0`** for supported overlay scripts.

## ‘Caps Lock mod’ editions

This modification features a ‘second Right Alt’ (AltGr) key via ‘Caps Lock’.  
The ‘Caps Lock’ behavior can be triggered (or toggled) by pressing both Shift keys together.  
See the folder **`autohotkey-capslock-mod`** for instructions.

## UltimateKEYS CE (Compact Edition) (testing)

This slimmed-down version does not have any dead keys on the layout, offering a more simplified approach (testing).  
See the folder **`compact-edition`** for more information.

## Overlay scripts for US-International keyboard layout

These scripts should have the exact same functionality as the main editions, but are intended as overlays for “United States-International” (all other AHK scripts are overlays for standard US QWERTY instead).  
See the folder **`autohotkey-kbdusx`** for overlay scripts for “United States-International”.

## Belgian AZERTY

Belgian AZERTY layout in AHK (overlay scripts for US QWERTY). These scripts can also be used to learn about the different key remappings and assignments in AutoHotkey v1.1 and v2.0. See the folder **`belgian-azerty`**.

## Switching between ‘Classic’ and ‘SW’ operation with Scroll Lock

These versions allow you to switch dynamically between ‘Classic’ and ‘SW’ by using the Scroll Lock toggle.  
Scroll Lock off&nbsp;: &nbsp;‘Classic’ operation  
Scroll Lock on&nbsp;: &nbsp;‘SW’ operation  
**=&gt; Implemented into the SW editions for AutoHotkey.**

## Important - Security Warning

Otherwise, it might be impossible to type any Unicode character higher than “Basic Latin” at the login screen/prompt (due to a different keyboard configuration) !&emsp;**=&gt;&emsp;ACCOUNT LOCKOUT**
