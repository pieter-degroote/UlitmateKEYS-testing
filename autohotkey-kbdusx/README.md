# Overlay scripts for US-International (AutoHotkey v1.1/v2.0)

These scripts should have the exact same functionality as the main editions, but are intended as overlays for “United States-International” (all other AHK scripts are overlays for standard US QWERTY instead).

Note that ‘AltGr+Shift’ should not cause any interference with the base ‘US-International’ layout. That way, there is no need for any scripts with ‘{blind}{vkE8}’.

Supported AutoHotkey versions&nbsp;: &nbsp;v1.1 and v2.0
