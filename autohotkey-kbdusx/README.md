# Overlay scripts for US-International (AutoHotkey v1.1/v2.0)

These scripts should have the exact same functionality as the main editions, but are intended as overlays for “United States-International” (all other AHK scripts are overlays for standard US QWERTY instead).

Supported AutoHotkey versions&nbsp;: &nbsp;v1.1 and v2.0
