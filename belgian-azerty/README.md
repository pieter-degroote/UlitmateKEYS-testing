# Belgian AZERTY for AutoHotkey v1.1/v2.0

Belgian AZERTY layout in AHK (overlay scripts for US QWERTY).  
These scripts can also be used to learn about the different key remappings and assignments in AutoHotkey v1.1 and v2.0.

When two or more languages/keyboards are installed on the system, the default ‘Alt+Shift’ sequence can interfere with the AHK scripts.

To avoid this, you can disable the interfering key sequences at&nbsp;:

*Settings -&gt; Language -&gt; Spelling, typing &amp; keyboard settings (on the right) -&gt; Advanced keyboard settings -&gt; Input language hot keys*

Another option is to run the scripts with ‘{blind}{vkE8}’ in the filenames as these will also suppress the switch.
