When two or more languages/keyboards are installed on the system, the default ‘Alt+Shift’ sequence can interfere with the AHK scripts.

To avoid this, you can disable the interfering key sequences at&nbsp;:

*Settings -&gt; Language -&gt; Spelling, typing &amp; keyboard settings (on the right) -&gt; Advanced keyboard settings -&gt; Input language hot keys*

Another option is to run the script with ‘Send {blind}{vkE8}’ in the filename as this will also suppress the switch.
