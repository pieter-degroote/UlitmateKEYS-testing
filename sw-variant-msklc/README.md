# UltimateKEYS - SW Variant (MSKLC)

This modification features the SW (or 'switched') variant of UltimateKEYS for MSKLC (Windows).

This means that the symbols !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, \*, (, ) are directly accessible and the numbers via Shift.

Please note that this is a slimmed-down version (without Compose key), since MSKLC does not support multiple keystrokes as a sequence for a dead key.
